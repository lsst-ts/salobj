Track all command responses instead of discarding responses with unexpected command ID.
    Is this necessary? Is it actually possible to have more than one instance
    of a given command running at the same time?
    If it is, then each time a command is issued, register interest in that cmd_id.
    Then as a command is finished, remove the info from the registry (being sure
    to first notify the user, as usual -- that part may be a bit tricky to get right).

Get rid of the SAL libraries.
    This will require a way of finding them elsewhere.

Report replycodes as strings, not numbers, if a name can be matched.

Print a traceback for exceptions unless the exception is an ExpectedError.
