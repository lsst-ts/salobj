class Controller:
    """A class that receives commands for a SAL component
    and sends telemetry and events from that component.

    This class provides much of the behavior for `BaseCsc`,
    basically everything except the standard summary states
    and associated transition commands.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        Name of SAL component.
    index : `int` or `None` (optional)
        SAL component index, or 0 or None if the component is not indexed.
        A value is required if the component is indexed.
    do_callbacks : `bool` (optional)
        Set ``do_<name>`` methods as callbacks for commands?
        If True then there must be exactly one ``do_<name>`` method
        for each command.

    Attributes
    ----------
    log : `logging.Logger`
        A logger.
    salinfo : `SalInfo`
        SAL info.
    cmd_<command_name> : `topics.ControllerCommand`
        Controller command topic. There is one for each command supported by
        the SAL component.
    evt_<event_name> : `topics.ControllerEvent`
        Controller event topic. There is one for each event topic supported by
        the SAL component.
    tel_<telemetry_name> : `topics.ControllerTelemetry`
        Controller telemetry topic. There is one for each telemetry topic
        supported by the SAL component.

    .. _writing_a_controller:

    **Writing a Controller**

    (To write a CSC see :ref:`Writing a CSC<lsst.ts.salobj-writing_a_csc>`,
    instead)

    To write a controller that is not a CSC (one that does not provide
    the standard summary states and associated state transition commands):

    * Inherit from this class.
    * Provide all
      :ref:`Required Logging Attributes<required_logging_attributes>`;
      these are automatically provided to CSCs, but not other controllers.
    * Implement `close_tasks`.

    Here is an example that makes a Test controller and displays
    the topic-related attributes, but has no code to do anything
    useful with those topics (see `TestCsc` for that)::

        include salobj

        # the index is arbitrary, but a remote must use the same index
        # to talk to this controller
        test_controller = salobj.Controller("Test", index=5)
        print(dir(test_controller))

    You should see the following topic-related attributes:

    * Commands, each an instance of `topics.ControllerCommand`:

        * ``cmd_standby``
        * ``cmd_start``
        * ... and so on for all other standard CSC commands
        * ``cmd_setArrays``
        * ``cmd_setScalars``

    * Events, each an instance of `topics.ControllerEvent`:

        * ``evt_appliedSettingsMatchStart``
        * ``evt_errorCode``
        * ... and so on for all other standard CSC events
        * ``evt_arrays``
        * ``evt_scalars``

    * Telemetry, each an instance of `topics.ControllerTelemetry`
      (note that there are no standard CSC telemetry topics):

        * ``tel_arrays``
        * ``tel_scalars``


    .. _required_logging_attributes:

    **Required Logging Attributes**

    Each `Controller` must support the following topics,
    as specified in ts_xml in ``SALGenerics.xml``:

    * setLogLevel command
    * logLevel event
    * logMessage event
